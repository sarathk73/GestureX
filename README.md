# GestureX
GestureX is an OpenCV-based hand motion sensing system for intuitive, efficient user control.This project aims to investigate the potential of creating a vision-based gesture recognition system using OpenCV to accurately and efficiently recognize hand gestures for computer control.
Computer vision techniques and OpenCV
library will be employed to create a system that does not
require specialized hardware, thus making it accessible to a
broader audience.
