## Project Overview

GestureX revolutionizes user interaction with its cutting-edge hand-tracking module, leveraging advanced computer vision technology to decode physical hand gestures. This creates an intuitive and seamless user interface, allowing users to perform a wide array of tasks with a mere wave of their hand, eliminating the need for traditional input devices such as a mouse or keyboard.

### Key Features

- **Precise Hand Tracking:** Utilizes `HandTrackingModule.py` for accurate tracking of hand landmarks.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Interprets various hand gestures to perform tasks using `gestureX.py`.
- **Real-Time Responsiveness:** Achieves high frames-per-second (FPS) rate for a fluid user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Requires no specialized hardware, making it accessible for a broader audience.
- **Multifunctional Controls:** Offers a range of control options from simple cursor movements to complex commands like opening drives or applications.

## Technologies Used

GestureX is built with a stack centered around Python and OpenCV, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [AutoPy](https://autopy.org/)
- [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## Getting Started

To get started with GestureX, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- AutoPy

Once the prerequisites are installed, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GestureX.git
cd GestureX
```
Run gestureX.py to start the hand gesture control system.
```bash
python gestureX.py
```
## Documentation 

For detailed understanding, here's a brief on the main modules:

  - HandTrackingModule.py: This module is central to the project, incorporating Mediapipe and OpenCV to track hand landmarks in real-time and provide necessary coordinates for gesture recognition.
  - gestureX.py: Built upon the HandTracking module, it interprets the hand landmarks to perform various control actions like mouse movement, clicks, and executing system commands.
